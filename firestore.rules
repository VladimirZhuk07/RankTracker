/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles. Users can only read, update, or delete their own profile data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user profile data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create their own profile.
 * - Users cannot list all profiles.

     * @deny (get, update, delete) - User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot get, update, or delete the profile with ID 'user_abc'.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations.
